# SIM-001 – Phishing Email (T1566.002) – Spearphishing Link

## 🎯 Goal

Simulate a phishing email that delivers a suspicious URL to a user, then validate that:

- Network telemetry (Suricata/Zeek via Security Onion) observes the click,
- Endpoint telemetry (Windows Security Event 4688 with command line logging) records browser execution,
- Splunk correlates these signals into a detection and triggers a validated alert.

This simulation supports the **LAB-SIM-001** row in the `detection-validation-matrix.md`.

## ✅ Success Criteria (Validated)

- A user on the Windows 11 endpoint opens a **test phishing email** and clicks a suspicious URL ✅  
- Windows generates **EventCode 4688** for `chrome.exe` ✅  
- The phishing URL appears in **`Process_Command_Line`** ✅  
- Security telemetry confirms HTTP traffic to Kali ✅  
- Splunk correlates endpoint execution and URL ✅  
- Splunk triggers an alert with symbolic ID:
